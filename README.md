# 🚨 Emergency Health Access via Med-blockchain-beta

This is a product of unit ENG40011 | Enginnering Technology Innovation Project happned in Swinburne Univeticity.

Basically this will be a block chain system that we can 

A secure, fast, and privacy-preserving solution to access patient health records during emergencies — powered by **Hyperledger Fabric**.

## 📘 Project Overview

This project addresses a critical issue in emergency medicine: **delayed or restricted access to medical records** when patients are unconscious or unable to communicate. We propose a **permissioned blockchain** solution that allows **emergency responders** to quickly and securely access vital medical information.

> ⚠️ In critical moments, lack of information can cost lives. This system solves that.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🔐 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  Access is defined by smart contracts based on the user’s role.

- ⚡ **Rapid Response**  
  Average data access time reduced to ~2–3 seconds.

- 🛡️ **Secure & Compliant**  
  Encrypted credentials on-chain; medical data remains off-chain. Built to align with **HIPAA/GDPR** and **My Health Records Act (Australia)**.

- 📜 **Auditability**  
  Every access is logged immutably on the blockchain.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Blockchain Framework**: Hyperledger Fabric  
- **Smart Contracts**: Chaincode for access permissions  
- **Frontend**: Secure web portal for emergency responders  
- **Storage**: Encrypted metadata on-chain, records off-chain

## 🧩 Why Blockchain?

| Feature                    | Traditional Systems | Our Blockchain Solution       |
|---------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Data Integrity            | Vulnerable          | Immutable, tamper-proof       |
| Access Speed              | 7–8 sec             | ~2–3 sec                      |
| System Availability       | Centralized failures| Decentralized resilience      |
| Audit Trail               | Limited             | Full smart contract logs      |
| Patient Control           | None                | Full consent-based sharing    |
